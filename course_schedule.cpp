/* There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to
numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
possible for you to finish all courses?



Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is
possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take
course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
