# Coding Jamz

This repository contains my practice coding sessions. I try to solve interesting coding problems on almost every topic in Computer Science including:

- Arrays
- Linked List
- Maths & Stats
- Strings
- Trees
- Stacks and Queues
- Graphs
- Back Tracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Miscellaneous

Feel free to suggest any changes and optimizations.
