/* This program solve the problem of town judge:
In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor
   that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

        If the town judge exists, then:

                        1- The town judge trusts nobody.
                        2- Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town
   judge. 3- There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

        You are given trust, an array of pairs trust{i} = {a, b} representing
   that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

        If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the
   town judge.  Otherwise, return -1
