/* Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is
described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and
k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than
or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.


Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
